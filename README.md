- 👋 Hi, this Bahadir

- 👀 I used to be a consultant to cement industry, then changed industry and opened up a small shop to sell DOGO shoes. Then COVID19 hit and
- 👀 my little shop bankrupted. Since I had some .Net, SQL, HTML coding
- 👀 experience, huge experience in industrial project management I found 
- 👀 a IT & Project Management position. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python from scracth. And writing codes for fun.
- 🌱 I have developed a Dash Plotly application for data analysis, mostly by reading
- 🌱 help documents. And working on a student information database for my girlfriend's music school.
- 💞️ I can collaborate on Python based projects but my collaborators should keep in
- 💞️ mind that I my coding experience is limited yet my analytical thinking skills are
- 💞️ pretty good if not top notch.
